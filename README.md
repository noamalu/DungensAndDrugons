Title: Game of Thrones - The Battle for Westeros

Description:

Game of Thrones - The Battle for Westeros is a Java-based RPG game inspired by the popular TV series Game of Thrones. In this game, the player takes on the role of one of the iconic characters from the show, such as Jon Snow, Arya Stark, or Melisandre, and must navigate through various levels filled with enemies, traps, and other obstacles.

The game is implemented using various programming concepts and design patterns, such as object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and the visitor pattern. The game features a tile-based map, with each tile representing a different type of terrain or object, such as walls, enemies, or items.

One of the unique features of the game is its use of the visitor pattern to implement interactions between different game elements. For example, when a player moves onto an enemy tile, the game uses the visitor pattern to trigger a battle sequence between the player and the enemy.

The game also includes a variety of different game mechanics and features, such as leveling up, collecting items, and special abilities unique to each character. Additionally, the game has a rich and engaging storyline that draws from the rich lore and mythology of the Game of Thrones universe.

The codebase for Game of Thrones - The Battle for Westeros is open-source and available on GitHub. Developers can use this codebase as a reference or starting point for their own Java-based game projects, or contribute to the existing codebase and help make the game even better.
